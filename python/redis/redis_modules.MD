Redis has a rich ecosystem of modules that extend its core functionality. Here are some of the prominent Redis modules:

1. **RedisJSON** - previosuly ReJSON:
   - Allows you to store, query, and manipulate JSON documents in Redis.

2. **RediSearch**:
   - Provides full-text search and secondary indexing capabilities for Redis.

3. **RedisGraph**:
   - A graph database module for Redis, based on the Cypher query language.

4. **RedisBloom** - previosuly ReBloom:
   - Implements Bloom filters, Count-Min Sketch, Cuckoo filters, and Top-K filtering for probabilistic data structures.

5. **RedisTimeSeries**:
   - Designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of time-series data.

6. **RedisAI**:
   - Enables running deep learning and machine learning models within Redis.

7. **RedisGears**:
   - A serverless engine that allows for event-driven programming with infinite data processing capabilities.

8. **RedisGraph**:
    - Graph database module that uses sparse matrices to represent the graph internally.

9. **RedisML**:
    - Provides machine learning model serving capabilities in Redis.

10. **RedisCell**:
    - Implements rate limiting with Redis using the token bucket algorithm.

11. **RedisCluster**:
    - Adds advanced clustering capabilities to Redis.

12. **RedisQuotas**:
    - Implements user quotas and rate limiting.

13. **RedisRaft**:
    - Provides a consensus-based replication protocol using the Raft consensus algorithm.

These modules enhance Redis's functionality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications beyond its core capabilities as an in-memory data structure store.
