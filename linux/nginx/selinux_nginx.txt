If you're encountering a "502 Bad Gateway" error from Nginx and suspect that SELinux is involved 
(especially if you previously saw "Permission denied" errors in your logs), it's likely that SELinux 
is preventing Nginx from communicating with your upstream service (like a PHP-FPM pool, a Node.js app, etc.).
This can happen when the SELinux policies are not configured to allow Nginx to make network connections or access
certain files. Here's how to diagnose and resolve this issue:




 > Check and Interpret SELinux Audit Logs
  $ sudo grep nginx /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2why



- Restore Default Contexts
   If you've changed the SELinux contexts for files/directories 
   that Nginx needs to access, restore the default contexts:

$ sudo restorecon -Rv /path/to/nginx/directory



- Change SELinux Booleans:
   SELinux has a set of toggleable booleans that can adjust its
   behavior without creating a new policy. 

$ sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
$ sudo setsebool -P httpd_read_user_content 1
